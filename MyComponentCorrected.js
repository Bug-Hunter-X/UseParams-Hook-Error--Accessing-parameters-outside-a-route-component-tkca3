The solution is to ensure that the `useParams` hook is called within a component that's directly or indirectly rendered by a `Route` component.

```javascript
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const { id } = useParams(); //This now works!
  return <div>Component ID: {id}</div>;
}

function MyRoute() {
    return (
        <div>
            <MyComponent />
        </div>
    )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/:id" element={<MyRoute/>} />
    </Routes>
  );
}

export default App;
```
Now the `useParams` hook will work correctly, as `MyComponent` is rendered by `MyRoute`, which in turn is rendered by the route in App.js.
