In React Router Dom v6, attempting to use the `useParams` hook outside of a component rendered by a route will result in an error because the hook relies on the routing context provided by the router.  This often happens when trying to access parameters in a shared component used across different routes. For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const { id } = useParams(); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
  return <div>Component ID: {id}</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```
